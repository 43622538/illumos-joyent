illumos-joyent
==============

This is a git repo to hold Joyent's patches to the Illumos tree.

We're using the nvie git branching model:

http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

The working tree is the 'develop' branch.  Commit code there, or
on a feature branch.

The upstream Illumos tree will be checked into the 'illumos' vendor
branch.
